* Summary and checklist of the assessment process (p 10)
  * The Cybermeter assessment process begins when management initiates the assessment by defining its scope and appointing a sponsor and facilitator.
  * In the preparation stage, they outline the operating area, identify key systems and data, involve necessary specialists, and agree on the assessment method and schedule.
  * The facilitator then conducts the assessment using the Cybermeter self-assessment tool. Afterwards, results are analysed to set target maturity levels and prioritise development activities. 
  *Finally, the organisation implements these improvements, updates the assessment, and, if needed, starts a re-assessment to ensure continuous progress.
