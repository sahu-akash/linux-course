#### Summary and checklist of the assessment process (p 10)
  * The Cybermeter assessment process begins when management initiates the assessment by defining its scope and appointing a sponsor and facilitator.
  * In the preparation stage, they outline the operating area, identify key systems and data, involve necessary specialists, and agree on the assessment method and schedule.
  * The facilitator then conducts the assessment using the Cybermeter self-assessment tool. Afterwards, results are analysed to set target maturity levels and prioritise development activities. 
  * Finally, the organisation implements these improvements, updates the assessment, and, if needed, starts a re-assessment to ensure continuous progress.


#### 3 Cybermeter maturity model (p 11-14)
  * Cybermeter is a maturity model used to assess and improve an organisation’s cybersecurity capabilities.
  * It evaluates cybersecurity across four maturity levels (0–3), helping organisations identify their current state and progress toward stronger, more systematic practices.
      * Maturity Levels
         * Level 0: Activities do not meet basic requirements.
         * Level 1: Basic requirements are met but in an ad hoc and inconsistent manner.
         * Level 2: Activities are advanced and comprehensive, supported by:
           * Documented processes and practices
           * Adequate resources and skills
           * Clear roles and responsibilities
         * Level 3: Activities are highly advanced, policy-driven, monitored, and continuously improved, aligned with organisational standards.
   * Its important to understand 4 concepts in order to apply the framework and interpret its results correctly
     * Capability: Ability to operate effectively using processes, people/skills, and information/systems. Cybermeter evaluates and supports the development of cybersecurity capabilities.
     * Maturity Model: A staged structure where each level has defined objectives representing best practices; organisations aim to move to higher levels.
     * Operating Area: Critical services, processes, systems, and data that must be assessed for cybersecurity; must be clearly defined for accurate evaluation.

   * Cybermeter consists of 11 cybersecurity domains, objectives set for each domain and practices that measure the fulfilment of the objectives
       * Cybermeter includes 11 cybersecurity domains:
         1. Critical services protection
         2. Risk management
         3. Supply chain/external dependencies
         4. Asset, change & configuration management
         5. Identity & access management
         6. Threat & vulnerability management
         7. Situational awareness
         8. Incident response
         9. Workforce management
         10. Cybersecurity architecture
         11. Program management
     * Each domain contains 3–5 objectives, totaling 52 objectives across the framework.
         * The objectives and their inherent practices represent either: 
            * Cybersecurity objectives (protecting against threats)
            * General management objectives (stabilising operations; not required at Level 1)
     * Maturity indicator level calculation model
       * The Cybermeter model determines an organisation’s maturity level (0–3) based on which cybersecurity practices are implemented and their difficulty level. The calculation consists of three stages.
        * Stage 1 – Assess Practice Implementation
          * Each practice is evaluated using four response options:
             1. Not implemented – practice is not in use
             2. Partly implemented – early or flawed implementation
             3. Mostly implemented – largely implemented, minor improvements needed
             4. Completely implemented – fully implemented, no major improvements needed
         * Stage 2 – Calculate Maturity Level per Objective. Maturity indicator levels are defined by the percentage of implemented practices:
             - Level 1: 100% of Level 1 practices implemented
             - Level 2:
                - More than 50% of Level 2 practices implemented
                - All Level 1 practices implemented
             - Level 3:
                - More than 50% of Level 3 practices implemented
                - All Level 1 and Level 2 practices implemented
           * Stage 3 – Calculate Maturity Level per Domain
               - The maturity indicator level of the domains is defined according to the maturity indicator level of the lowest objective in the domain.
               - If a domain consists of three objectives, whose maturity indicator levels are 1, 2 and 3, the domain’s maturity indicator level will be the lowest of these, i.e. maturity indicator level 1.

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core report
  * The report is particularly intended for cybersecurity and risk management professionals and other technically responsible persons intented for the analysis and reporting of the assessment results and for guiding internal development
  * The results are presented in accordance with Cybermeter’s 11 cybersecurity capabilities.
  * How the maturity levels are calculated:
    * Follows the Cybermeter scoring model (described earlier in Section 3.3)
    * Compared to C2M2, Cybermeter uses a lighter scoring method at Levels 2 and 3
    * Level can be reached if:
      * ≥50% of practices at that level are implemented
      * 100% of all practices at lower levels are implemented


#### Traficom: Kybermittari spreadsheet (The actual tool)
The Cybermeter Excel workbook is a complete cybersecurity maturity assessment tool containing domain-specific assessment sheets (e.g., risk management, incident response, access management), investment tracking, automated maturity reports, NIST mapping, and export/import functions. It guides organizations through evaluating their cybersecurity capabilities across 11 domains, calculating maturity levels, benchmarking results, and generating both technical and management-level reports—all supported by background data, parameters, and version history within the file.



#### Scene: Evaluating Risk Management Practices

Practice A: Mostly Implemented
Discussion topic: Risks related to critical services are identified and documented
people involved are 
Ray - Security expert
Olli - operations manager
Sara - IT admin
Ravi - Risk officer

Ray :
“Let’s begin with how well we identify risks for our critical logistics service.”

Olli:
“From the operations side, we definitely know the main risks. We keep a list — delays, system outages, supplier failures.”

Sara:
“And on the IT side, we have a vulnerability list and some known system risks.”

Ravi:
“Our risk register is not perfect, but it does contain the essential items. We review it annually.”

Ray:
“Sounds like we can mark this as Mostly Implemented.”

Everyone agrees.


Practice B: Partly Implemented
Discussion topic: “Risks are regularly reviewed and updated.”

Ravi:
“This is where we struggle. Updates are irregular — sometimes every 6 months, sometimes not for a year.”

Sara:
“And new risks, like cloud migration issues, take a long time to get added.”

Olli:
“I only hear about risk reviews when something goes wrong.”

Ray:
“So this is not fully systematic. I’d say Partly Implemented.”



#### How could the Cybermeter process be really useless?

Cybermeter can become meaningless or ineffective if the process is handled poorly. It becomes useless when:
1. People ignore the checklist to meet deadlines and postpone the checklist activities.
2. Results are manipulated.
3. People driving dont define the scope.

#### How could the Cybermeter process be really useful?

1. It builds a shared understanding across business and technical teams
2. Cybermeter identifies
    * Gaps
    * Required maturity levels
    * Concrete development actions
    * Investment needs
    * It helps organizations move from reactive to proactive cybersecurity.
3. cybersecurity readiness and enables benchmarking

#### What models/tools could compete with Cybermeter?

1. ISO 27001 / 27005: 
2. C2M2 (Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model)
4. EU initiated Cyber resilience act
